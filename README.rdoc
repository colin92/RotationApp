RotationApp is a rotating schedule planner written in Ruby on Rails. It connects with your google account, allowing you to create a rotation schedule (automatically generated at regular intervals, such as monthly), and add it to your google calendar, as well as the google calendars of the others on the rotation schedule (this functionality requires you to input each respective members gmail address to work optimally).
